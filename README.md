# UK Grid BESS Analytics

A comprehensive collection of projects exploring electricity demand analytics, economic dispatch, and battery storage optimization in the UK power grid. This repository contains a series of interconnected analyses and optimizations focused on understanding and improving the UK's electricity grid operations.

## üìã Project Overview

This repository is organized into four main sections, each focusing on a different aspect of grid analytics and optimization:

### 1. UK National Grid Demand Data Analysis
- Analysis of historical electricity demand data
- Visualization of demand patterns and trends
- Statistical analysis of demand distribution
- Key visualizations:
  - Monthly demand patterns
  - Daily demand with 7-day rolling averages
  - Demand distribution analysis
  - Average demand patterns

### 2. Predicting UK Electricity Demand (ML)
- Machine learning models for demand forecasting
- Feature importance analysis
- Model performance evaluation
- Visualizations:
  - Top feature importance
  - Model predictions vs. actual demand
  - Test set performance analysis

### 3. Economic Dispatch Optimization
- Optimization of power generation dispatch
- Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) integration
- Cost minimization strategies
- Two main components:
  - Dispatching optimization
  - BESS arbitrage analysis

### 4. BESS Arbitrage Profit Maximization
- Analysis of battery storage arbitrage opportunities
- Market price analysis
- Profit optimization strategies
- Includes detailed market analysis documentation

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Required Python packages (install using `pip install -r requirements.txt`):
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
  - scikit-learn
  - [Additional packages will be listed in requirements.txt]

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kianjn/uk-grid-bess-analytics.git
   cd uk-grid-bess-analytics
   ```

2. Install required packages:
   ```bash

## üìä Data

The project uses UK National Grid demand data from 2024, stored in CSV format. The data includes:
- Timestamp
- Electricity demand
- Additional features for ML analysis

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

Each section contains its own Python script and can be run independently:

1. Demand Analysis:
   ```bash
   python "01.UK National Grid Demand Data Analysis/01.py"
   ```

2. Demand Prediction:
   ```bash
   python "02.Predicting UK Electricity Demand.ML/02.py"
   ```

3. Economic Dispatch:
   ```bash
   python "03.Economic Dispatch Optimization/01.Dispatching/dispatch.py"
   ```

4. BESS Optimization:
   ```bash
   python "03.Economic Dispatch Optimization/02.BESS Arbitrage/bess_arbitrage.py"
   ```

## üìà Results
